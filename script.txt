Social Security has made a big change to prevent fraud, and it's already creating major headaches for people who rely on those benefits. If you've ever had to wait on hold for hours or struggle with government websites, then you need to know about what's happening right now. Stick with me because we're going to break down what's changed, who it affects, and what you need to do to navigate this new system. Because there are actually some things that you can do today to make dealing with these changes easier.
So, before we dive into all those details though, I am just curious. Have you ever waited on the phone to talk to someone at Social Security? If so, drop a quick yes in the comments and let me know how long you spent on hold for that call. I've heard a lot of conflicting reports about the wait times and I really want to know what your experience has been like.
So without further ado, let's get into exactly what's happening and who is being affected by this.
Starting April 14th, Social Security stopped allowing people to verify their identity over the phone for certain changes. Instead, if you're a new retirement or survivor claimant, or if you need to update your direct deposit information, you now have to verify your identity online through the My Social Security portal. If you're not able to do that, then you're going to have to visit a Social Security field office in person. You can no longer verify your identity over the phone for these services.
Now, there are some exceptions to this rule. If you receive SSI, Medicare, or Disability benefits, you can still verify by phone for now. But if you're trying to claim new retirement or survivor benefits, or if you need to update your direct deposit or personal information, the phone option is gone.
I know this is really stressful because a lot of Social Security beneficiaries aren't going to be able to verify their identities online. It's not exactly an easy process. If you aren't comfortable with technology or if you don't have a device that's even capable of it, or if you live in a rural area without good internet access, this is a real struggle.
And here's something that makes it even more complicated: Social Security is now using a new fraud detection system. If you're flagged as a potential risk for any reason, you must verify your identity in person or online, even for basic requests. So even if you think you might qualify for phone verification, you could still get forced into the online or in-person route.
Children still aren't allowed to have a My Social Security account. So, if you're calling on behalf of a child who gets these benefits, you're going to have to go to the field office no matter what.
Add that to the fact that they've already closed 47 field offices in rural areas, and the fact that it still takes more than a month to get an appointment in many cases, and this change has made it much harder for many people to access their benefits, especially for seniors, people with disabilities, and families with children.
And here's what's coming next: On August 18th, there's another proposed change that may require a PIN verification process for many phone requests. This could increase field office visits by 3.4 million per year. So if you think things are complicated now, they might get even more challenging.
So, why are they doing this? The Social Security Administration says this change is necessary because of fraud. Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek has revealed that over $100 million per year is lost to direct deposit fraud. Scammers have been able to steal Social Security benefits by answering security questions over the phone and then changing the bank account information, which reroutes your Social Security benefits to their accounts.
That's because a lot of those security questions rely on publicly available information like your mother's maiden name, past addresses, and so on. Unfortunately, a lot of times your address, phone numbers, and relatives information can be found easily with a simple online search. There are a lot of data brokers out there who make their money by gathering and publishing your personal data. Massive data breaches have also become more common, which puts your sensitive information, including your social security numbers, at even more risk.
It's really important to do everything you can to protect your personal information online, even when that feels like an impossible task. And trust me, I get it. I am familiar with that struggle because I've lived it myself. As a YouTuber and a content creator, I have put a lot of information online about myself and my family. It's been scary because I've received death threats and I've even had people track down my personal phone number in the past.
Delete Me is a service that has helped keep my family safe by actively looking for and removing our information from hundreds of different websites across the internet. It has even reduced the number of scam calls I receive, which has been fabulous. I have used Delete Me for years, and I honestly think that I'm going to keep using it for the rest of my life. If you would like to try it too, you can score a 20% discount by signing up at the link you see on screen. That's going to be lilinks.com/dm.
That should help keep you safe because it's the sheer amount of information available online that has enabled scammers to steal benefits. And that's why the SSA says that eliminating phone verification for these services is a common sense measure to prevent fraud.
They also claim that this change is a good thing because they've implemented a new banking verification system called AVS. Direct deposit updates can now be processed in just one business day instead of the previous 30-day wait period. But of course, there's a catch. That one day rule only applies if you can successfully verify your identity online or in person. If you have to verify your identity in person and you're facing long wait times for appointments, you could still experience significant delays.
So, while this change may speed things up for some, for others it's causing even more delays. Ultimately, even though their idea may sound good in theory, it's creating a lot of hardship in practice.
If you need to apply for new retirement or survivor benefits, or if you need to update your direct deposit information, you now only have two options. First, you can verify your identity online using the My Social Security portal, or if you can't do that, you're going to have to get an appointment and travel to a field office in person for that verification.
Now, for tech-savvy users, verifying online might not be that big of a deal. Some veterans may already be familiar with this process because the VA has been using ID.me login for some services. In fact, I recently used it to pull my husband's VA letters. We had to complete a few steps on our laptop and then switch to our phone to upload a picture of his ID and then go back to our laptop to click through a few more screens and finish out that process. It took us about 10 minutes, but then again, we're both very comfortable with technology like this.
For those who aren't, this has become a nightmare. Many Social Security recipients are elderly, disabled, or live in rural areas with little or no internet access. For those individuals, navigating an online verification system can be impossible. And now their only other option is to travel to a field office in person.
But with 47 field offices closed and SSA staff being cut, getting an appointment is not easy or convenient. Right now, the average call back time is 2 hours. And the average wait time for an appointment is still over a month in many areas. That is a lot of waiting.
This is especially concerning for families with children who receive benefits because they're not even allowed to create a My Social Security account in the first place. Every family with children on Social Security has to go to a field office just to update their basic information.
For people with mobility issues, limited transportation options, or no internet access, these delays mean waiting weeks or even months before receiving the benefits that they depend on to survive. And that is scary to me.
So, here's what you need to do right now to navigate this new system. First, make sure that you have set up your My Social Security account. If you haven't, do it as soon as possible. You can do this by going to ssa.gov and creating your account. You'll need to use either ID.me or login.gov to verify your identity. If you haven't already registered for one of those services, you'll have to set all of that up. I know it's a headache, but getting all of this set up now may be able to save you some time later because if you can verify your identity online, you may be able to avoid a trip to the field office.
Second, if you need to update your direct deposit information and you qualify for the new online or in-person verification, be prepared for the process. The good news is that once you complete verification, your direct deposit changes will process in just one business day thanks to their new AVS system.
Third, stay informed. These kinds of changes often come with complications and adjustments. With that August 18th deadline approaching for potential PIN verification requirements, things could get even more complicated. The best way to avoid issues is to be prepared. I will always do my best to keep you updated here at Low Income Relief.
